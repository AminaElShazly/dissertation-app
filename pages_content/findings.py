    ("02", "Audit for hallucinated causation, not just numerical errors.",
     "The most frequent failure mode (HM2) was the introduction of causal mechanisms absent from the data — \"driven by modern medicine,\" \"due to lifestyle factors.\" These are the hardest errors to catch because they sound knowledgeable."),
    ("03", "Pair explanations with a comprehension prompt, not just a \"read more\" link.",
     "A short, specific question (\"which group changed most?\") forces re-engagement with the chart and disrupts the substitution effect. Passive disclaimers do not."),
    ("04", "Do not assume your expert audiences are protected.",
     "Visualisation experience showed <strong>zero protective effect</strong> (ρ = −0.005). The \"we're only sending this to clinicians\" defence is empirically unsupported."),
    ("05", "Increase scrutiny as chart complexity rises.",
     "Both models degraded monotonically with complexity (ρ ≈ −0.65). Information density is the primary driver of accuracy loss — not chart type. Multi-series, multi-axis, or annotated charts need the most review."),

_DESIGNER_RULES = [
    ("01", "Build calibration-aware UIs, not just accurate models.",
     "Accuracy and user confidence dissociated in this study: confidence stayed flat even when accuracy varied (ρ = +0.37, ns). Surfacing uncertainty <strong>at the point of reading</strong> matters more than improving the model in isolation."),
    ("02", "Mark inferential content distinctly from descriptive content.",
     "The dangerous output blends what the chart shows with what the model thinks it means. Visually separate the two — descriptive sentences should look and feel different from inferential ones."),
    ("03", "Require prompted self-verification before high-stakes actions.",
     "When an explanation precedes a clinical, financial, or policy decision, interpose a step that requires the user to locate the relevant value on the chart themselves. The friction is the feature."),
    ("04", "Test for over-reliance, not just accuracy benchmarks.",
     "A chart-explanation feature can score well on standard NLG metrics and still degrade comprehension. Run within-subjects user studies with comprehension questions — the dissociation only shows up against a chart-only baseline."),
    ("05", "Suppress causal language unless the chart supports it.",
     "HM2 hallucinations appeared on 43 of 45 Claude explanations under a structured prompt. A simple post-hoc filter — \"does this sentence describe data, or causation?\" — would catch most of them at low cost."),
